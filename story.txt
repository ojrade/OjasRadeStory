There once was a young boy sitting at his home getting ready for school. He was a pretty average kid,
not to popular, but not a nobody. He was fairly good looking, and had a decent amount of friends. This 
was a special day though, and the kid did not know it.

The boy heard the bus roll up to his house, and he sprinted outside to get on. When he got to the door of
 the bus he noticed that something was different. When the door opened up, the bus driver was none else
 than Mrs. Frizzle from The Magic Schoolbus. All of his classmates were on the bus already and they all
 seemed pretty excited. Once he sat down, the bus started spinning and they began to travel through time.

 When everything stopped he looked out the window, and he could tell that he wasn't in his hometown anymore.
It takes him a while to get orientated
He looks aroudn to try and figure out where this strange bus has taken him only to find that his classmates are equally confused.
He looked more at his surroundings and saw the Roman Colosseum in the distance.
"So I'm in Rome," he thought "but what time peroid is it?"

"The Roman Colosseum was built in 72 AD - 82 years." he thought

As he is admiring the sites, he realizes that he is lost. He decides to walk around and he notices many 
people are staring at him and he wonders why. Then a realization hits him. He probably looks out of place 
in his modern clothes, and he doesn't even speak the language. He frantically searched till he found the 
bus and jumped back on relieved
