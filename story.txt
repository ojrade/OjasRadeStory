There once was a young boy sitting at his home getting ready for school. He was a pretty average kid,
not to popular, but not a nobody. He was fairly good looking, and had a decent amount of friends. This 
was a special day though, and the kid did not know it.

The boy heard the bus roll up to his house, and he sprinted outside to get on. When he got to the door of
 the bus he noticed that something was different. When the door opened up, the bus driver was none else
 than Mrs. Frizzle from The Magic Schoolbus. All of his classmates were on the bus already and they all
 seemed pretty excited. Once he sat down, the bus started spinning and they began to travel through time.
 When everything stopped he looked out the window, and he could tell that he wasn't in his hometown anymore.
